Title: 
    Create custom class for buttons objects

Description:
    Create custom class, which will manage GUI buttons objects.
    Button object as far as possible should contain:
    * text
    * border
    * different style behavior when clicked and released e.g. when user click
      the button, it should change its color into few shade lighter one
    * possibility to connect its clicked behavior with some more functionalities
      like e.g. showing separate message dialog (so I suggest to consider perhaps
      not use a lambda but basic function, because as far as I understand lambda 
      in Python is a one-line function (obviously I can be wrong, so it's need to check it))
    Also remember that:
    * it should be possible to easily change every element of this object
    * stuff like e.g. text font, background color should be the same for each object (so I suggest
      consider usage of some kind of static variables (if they are the same in Python as they are in C++))
    There's no need to create separate main file only to show this implementation, but please add directory
    in which one add some screens/photos with example objects (you can temporarily add few instance of this
    class to main window, make screens and then remove them).
    Don't forget to prepare documentation for this class!
