Title: 
    Create custom class for title objects

Description:
    Create custom class, which will manage GUI title objects.
    Title object as far as possible should contain: 
    * title as a basic text
    * some kind of background (it can be simply different color or even e.g. some faded picture)
    * border
    Also remember that:
    * it should be possible to easily change every element of this object
    * stuff like e.g. text font, background color should be the same for each object (so I suggest
      consider usage of some kind of static variables (if they are the same in Python as they are in C++))
    There's no need to create separate main file only to show this implementation, but please add directory
    in which one add some screens/photos with example objects (you can temporarily add few instance of this
    class to main window, make screens and then remove them).
    Don't forget to prepare documentation for this class!
