Title: 
    Create initial part of application

Description:
    Create initial part of application especially:
    * main file with launched main GUI window (this window will be only used to testing other
      components in the nearest future, so code don't have to be super clear, perfect and long, 
      because it will be probably replaced anyway)
    * shortcut, which immediately run application (e.g. using double-clicked mouse left button event)
    Remember that if creating shortcut will need more lines of code it's good to prepare a separate 
    function/class for this activity (obviously with documentation).
